* SimpliPy (WIP)
SimpliPy is a /simple/ Python interpreter modelled as a *transition system*.

The main goals of this interpreter are:
+ Cover a core subset of the language, including most control flow constructs and Python's rich scoping.
+ Construct precise semantics of this subset, faithful to /CPython/.
+ Build a better understanding and a mental model of Python.

*Note*: This project uses [https://github.com/RustPython/Parser][RustPython's parser] to generate the AST and only focuses on the semantics.

* Non-Goals
+ Cover the full syntax and semantics of Python.
+ Write a highly optimized interpreter.
